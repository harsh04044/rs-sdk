//! CEP-8 transparent-lifecycle server payment middleware.
//!
//! A priced invocation is gated at the transport seam: the middleware emits
//! `notifications/payment_required`, waits for the configured [`PaymentProcessor`]
//! to verify settlement, emits `notifications/payment_accepted`, and only then
//! forwards the request to the MCP handler. A dynamic pricing callback can
//! reject the invocation (emitting `notifications/payment_rejected` and
//! dropping it) or waive payment (forwarding it untouched). Duplicate
//! deliveries of one request event share one payment and are never charged
//! twice within the configured bounds.
